# AT1 - Concept:

## "What cute is ?"

As provided insights of "cute" from Sianne Ngai, ‚Äúcute‚Äù seen as an aesthetic category can be understood in the context of its emotional resonance and socio-economic implications in contemporary society. The notion of "cute" transcends mere visual appeal, embedding itself in the fabric of our daily interactions, consumer habits, and emotional landscapes.

**"Cute" embodies an aesthetic** that draws on the warmth of intimacy and domesticity, engaging our nurturing instincts and evoking a sense of comfort and care. It is not just about the physical appearance of objects or beings but also about the emotional and relational dynamics they inspire. For instance, some social media accounts post their pets in adorable poses which craft comfortable and intimate feeling from viewers. 

**Besides, ‚Äúcute‚Äù aesthetics also drives to consumption patterns,** it can commodify and manipulated in a market-driven society. For example, the success of ‚ÄúHello Kitty‚Äù commercial underscores how ‚Äúcute‚Äù category can attract consumer behavior and encourage the essence of care and comfort through its ‚Äúcute‚Äù appearance. 

**Moreover, ‚Äúcute‚Äù reflects the complexities of labor,** communication, and consumption in late capitalist society. For example, the trend of decor ‚Äúcute‚Äù office supplies in office work for making the workplace aesthetically pleasing and create personal comfort emotion, potentially masking the pressures and economic expectations in reality. Overall, ‚Äúcute‚Äù offers insight into how aesthetic experiences are shaped by contemporary economic and social dynamics.

**In conclusion, "cute" is not only an aesthetic category,** it is also a cultural phenomenon that reflects and shapes contemporary societal dynamics. It challenges us to rethink our relationships with the. As we engage with "cute" in art, media, and everyday objects, we navigate a sequence of emotion or consumption, highlighting the transformative potential of aesthetic experiences in the current era.

## "What effective complexity is ?"

**"Effective complexity" is a nuanced concept** that bridges the gap between utter randomness and strict order, finding its significance in systems that harmonize both elements to create something intriguing and comprehensible. 

It's a way to evaluate the richness of a system's structure, looking for a sweet spot where patterns are neither too predictable nor too chaotic. This system with high effective complexity are neither completely random nor entirely ordered, but display patterns that are complex enough to be interesting yet not so disordered.

**For example,**

The Infinite Jukebox," a web app created by Paul Lamere that allows users to upload a song, which is then analyzed and broken down into beats. The app identifies similar sounding beats within the song and creates pathways that allow the song to play forever in a non-repetitive manner by jumping between these similar beats. 

This concept is the balance between order and chaos, because listeners can recognize the songs, but the path is dynamically generated and changed in each session. Due to unpredictable, it keeps user experience fresh and engaging prolonged interaction. "The Infinite Jukebox" mirrors this complexity through music‚Äîa form of digital art work, deeply intertwined with human emotion and cognition.

## "How it functions within a cute aesthetic frame ?"

When considering the "cute aesthetic," effective complexity plays a vital role in creating art that is intimacy and endearing without being overly simplistic or chaotic. A cute aesthetic often relies on familiarity and comfort, evoking feelings of warmth and happiness through recognizable, simple patterns and subjects. However, incorporating a level of unpredictability within these familiar frameworks can make artwork more easily approach by comfort and interesting way.

For instance, interactive digital pets that respond to user actions in unexpected ways can be seen as embodying effective complexity within a cute aesthetic. These digital creatures may have predictable behaviors that endear users, but their occasional unpredictable reactions or growth patterns keep users engaged and interested over time. 
Another example could be animated weather widgets that not only display weather patterns but also incorporate changing elements based on real-time data, such as raindrops that playfully dance across the screen or clouds that change shape or color in delightful ways.

These examples show how effective complexity can enhance the engagement and aesthetic appeal of artworks by introducing a balanced mix of order and unpredictability. This blend not only reflects the complexity found in nature and human cognition but also attract us by a balance between familiarity and novelty.

# AT1 - Journey:

## 1. What about the work makes it belong to the aesthetic category of "cute"?

For this project, I choose the art work " tothewater" by Rafael Rozenddal to get an inspiration. The reasons it relates to cute aesthetic is:

**Simplicity and Minimalism :**

- The art work presented a simple object - glass of water which simply set in white background. This minimalistic evokes a sense of warm and comfort characteristics often associated with "cuteness." This everyday-object combines with familiar image and clean interface, can appeal to a feeling of innocent curiosity and delight, key factors  of what makes something "cute."

**Interactivity and Responsiveness :** 

- By enabling viewers to alter the glass's water level through a simple hover, the artwork gains a playful quality. Such interactivity mirrors acts of nurturing or caring for something by giving it attention, aligning with the nurturing qualities often found in ‚Äúcute‚Äù aesthetic. The act of hovering to "fill" the glass mimics a gentle, caring gesture, further enhancing its cuteness.

**Sound effects and Conceptual Charm :** 

- A glass of water brings a delightful twist to an everyday object. This transformation, driven by user interaction, adds an enchanting surprise element by adding sound effects when users water increase, firmly placing the piece within the "cute" aesthetic realm.

## 2. How does the artist employ effective complexity in the work to achieve its aesthetic result?

**From Simple Actions to Rich Variability :** 

 - Rozendaal cleverly demonstrates how a fundamental interaction, such as the use of a basic interaction (hovering) can lead to diverse and unpredictable outcomes and changes in the water level exemplifies ‚Äúeffective complexity‚Äù. 

**Random System Dynamics :** 

 - The artwork creates a dynamic system where the outcome is not linear. This unpredictability in how the glass will move randomly when users hover the glass of water or how quickly it will "fill" introduces a level of complexity that engages users in a continuous discovery process, encouraging repeated interaction and exploration.

**Cause and effect in visual changes :** 
 - This straightforward interaction leads to a multitude of visual states, illustrating how direct inputs can result in a complex array of outcomes, thereby enriching the artwork's aesthetic and interactive depth.

## 3. Document your creative process in responding to Rozendaal's work.

- Drawing inspiration from Rafael Rozendaal's work, my concept introduces an interactive glass of water set against a light-blue pastel background, embodying both cuteness and complexity. Hovering over the glass changes the weather in the digital scene, seamlessly transitioning from sunshine to rain and back, showcasing the profound impact of simple interactions on the environment. This project blends playful engagement with a deeper exploration of cause and effect.

## Atrribute to retain:

-	**Interactive Simplicity :** 

Like Rozendaal‚Äôs work, your concept maintains the simplicity of interaction ‚Äì the hover effect that alters the water level in a glass. This straightforward engagement is powerful, allowing users to easily understand their impact on the artwork.

-	**Visual Transformation :**

Rozendaal‚Äôs glass of water changes in response to user interaction. Similarly, my decision is to retain this aspect of unpredictability and visual change. The randomness serves as a bridge between the user's action and the artwork's response, emphasizing the dynamism inherent in interactive art.

-	**Minimalist Aesthetic :** 

My inspired by Rozendaal‚Äôs minimalist approach, focuses on a everyday object which evokes the feeling of cute aesthetic. The use of pastel colors and a clean, uncluttered design echoes for simplicity and visual clarity.

## Attribute to change:

-	**Complexity of Interaction :** 

While Rozendaal‚Äôs work primarily focuses on the glass and its contents, my concept introduces a broader environmental narrative. By linking the water level to weather changes, my project adds a layer of complexity and depth to the interactive experience, enhancing the scope of user influence.

-	**Narrative Depth :** 

By linking the water level in the cup to weather changes, my work implies a narrative of ecological interconnectivity. This progression from a stable state through a rainy period to a sunny condition depending on the user's engagement introduces a temporal dimension absent from Rozendaal's original, making the experience more immersive and story-driven.

-    **Audiovisual Elements :**

The sound effects corresponding to weather changes enriches the sensory experience of your artwork. This enhancement not only deepens the user's experience but also underscores the environmental shifts being depicted, a significant expansion on the primarily visual of Rozendaal's piece.

## 4. In dialogue with the Rozendaal piece

My work engages in a dialogue with Rozendaal's piece through its foundational concept of interaction leading to transformation. However, by extending the consequences of this interaction to an environmental scale, your project explores the themes of influence and connectivity more expansively. 

In more details, my piece serves as a commentary on the original by suggesting that the simplicity found in everyday objects and actions can have profound implications. By expanding the scope of interaction from a glass of water to the environment itself, my work posits that our actions are intertwined with the larger world in complex and meaningful ways. It reflects on the delicate balance between human activity and natural phenomena, echoing the "butterfly effect" principle of small actions leading to significant outcomes. This thematic expansion places my work in a reflective dialogue with Rozendaal's, using the shared medium of cute aesthetic and effetively complexity to explore broader questions about interactivity and user immersive. 

In essence, my creative process involves taking the core interactive experience Rozendaal offers and weaving it into a more complex narrative about environmental interconnectivity and the power of individual actions. Last but not least, my project also extends boundaries to encourage participants to reflect on their connection with the environment.

## 5. Document the code

In this assignment, I created the "Make It Rain" effect. This effect begins with pouring weather,
featuring a dark, cloudy sky and a dim sun, alongside a glass filled with rainwater. The water level in
the glass changes according to the mouse's position. Lowering the mouse decreases the water level,
indicating vaporisation, and causes the sky and clouds to brighten, with less rain and a more
luminous sun. The number of raindrops changes linearly with the weather; heavy rain brings many
raindrops, while light rain results in fewer. Similarly, the colors of the clouds and sun adjust linearly
with the weather conditions. With sunny weather, the clouds become whiter and the sun more
yellow; conversely, during rain, both the clouds and sun appear darker. The speed of the cloud
movement also changes linearly with the weather: clouds move slower when it's sunny and faster
when it's raining. The sound of the rain scales linearly with the weather intensity as well; heavy rain
produces a loud sound, and light rain results in a softer sound. When it becomes sunny, the rain
sound stops, replaced by sunny sound. Hovering the mouse over the glass triggers its relocation to a
random spot within the canvas. Below is an example of the "Make It Rain" effect:

![re11](/23/re11.png)

To implement this effect, I find the most challenging parts to be:
- Drawing the empty glass using only simple shapes
- Drawing the water as it rises and recedes in the glass (this is the hardest part for me).
- Drawing raindrops and controlling their number based on the current weather.
- Changing the colour of the clouds and the sun according to the weather.
- Controlling the sound volume based on the weather conditions.
- Relocating the glass to a random location when the mouse hovers over it.
1. Drawing the empty glass using only simple shapes
I need to dynamically fill the glass with water, so importing a static image of a glass will not work because it cannot be filled. Therefore, I must draw the glass using simple shapes, enabling me to fill it with different colours later.
This is achieved by drawing two ellipses of different sizes: the larger ellipse represents the top of the glass, and the smaller ellipse represents the bottom. Then, I draw two lines to connect the leftmost and rightmost points of the two ellipses, forming the body of the glass. The code is as below:

![re12](/23/re12.png)
In which:
-	topX/topY: the x-position/y-position of the top ellipse
-	bottomX/bottomY: the x-position/y-position of the bottom ellipse
-	top_width/top_height: the width/height of the top ellipse
-	bottom_width/bottom_height: the width/height of the bottom ellipse
I have this function implemented inside the class ‚ÄúGlass‚Äù.
2.	Drawing the water as it rises and recedes in the glass
To visualise the water level in the glass, I need to use complex shape in p5. This water drawing is not as simple as drawing the glass (which has 2 ellipses and 2 lines). I need to use Custom Shapes.
First, I need to determine the width of the water surface. This changes linearly to the water level. I use pre-defined function lerp() to achieve this:

![re13](/23/re13.png)

Similarly, I measure the water height using the same approach:

![re14](/23/re14.png)

The location of the vertices on upper curve and the lower curve of the water are determined using the equation of ellipse: 

(r_x^2)/(R_x^2 )+(r_y^2)/(R_y^2 )=1

The code for can be seen as below:

![re15](/23/re15.png)

This function is also implemented inside the class ‚ÄúGlass‚Äù
3.	Drawing raindrops and controlling their number based on the current weather
I make a ‚ÄúRain‚Äù class to manage the raindrops and draw them. I have an array ‚Äúraindrops‚Äù to keep all the raindrops, each with different size and falling speed. Then based on the current water level in the glass, I adjust the reduce or increase of elements in the ‚Äúraindrops‚Äù array accordingly.  My ‚ÄúRain‚Äù class can be viewed as below:

![re16](/23/re16.png)

4.	Changing the colour of the clouds and the sun according to the weather
To manage the clouds and sun, I also have separate classes for them. 
The ‚ÄúClouds‚Äù class handle the initialisation of random clouds with different sizes, and based on the current water level, the moving speed of the clouds are adjusted proportionally. The ‚ÄúClouds‚Äù class is written as below:

![re17](/23/re17.png)


Similarly, for the ‚ÄúSun‚Äù class, it is responsible for drawing and managing the darkness of the sun‚Äôs colour. I use lerpColor() function to change the sun‚Äôs colour smoothly based on the weather.

![re18](/23/re18.png)

5.	Controlling the sound volume based on the weather conditions
I create a ‚ÄúBackground‚Äù class that can change the background colour from sunny to gloomy based on the water level of the glass. This class also handles the audio accordingly: if the weather is sunny, the sunny audio is played, if the weather is raining, the raining audio is played. The volume of the rain sound also scales linearly to the amount of rain.

![re19](/23/re19.png)

6.	Relocating the glass to a random location when the mouse hovers over it
This problem is not as challenging as above problems to me because I had the chance to practice the hovering effect in the previous assignment. Basically, I check the mouse‚Äôs location using mouseX and mouseY global variables and check them against the location of the glass.

In this work, I replicate the artwork "Open this window" - sliding curtain effect from Rafael Rozendaal, in which the user can open and close the curtain by clicking and dragging the mouse. If the curtain is opened, the background image of a rainforest is revealed and an audio sound of birds singing is played. If the curtain is closed, the background image is hidden, and the audio sound is off.

To implement this effect, I find the most challenging parts are:
-	How to determine if the mouse is pressed and released
-	How to track the mouse position
-	How to play an audio

Since in the last few weeks, I haven‚Äôt learnt or worked on a problem that requires user‚Äôs interaction with the interface. Hence, I need to do a few research to learn how to do it in JaveScript.

In order to detect if the mouse is pressed, I use the pre-defined function mousePressed() in p5.js. According to the official documentation [1], the mousePressed() function is called once after every time a mouse button is pressed. 

![re8](/23/re8.png)
 
Similarly, I need to detect if the mouse is released, so that I can stop moving the curtain. I use the pre-defined function mouseReleased() from p5.js for this. According to the official documentation [2], the mouseReleased() function is called every time a mouse button is released.

![re9](/23/re9.png)

Finally, to track the mouse position, I use the system variable mouseX, which always contains the current horizontal position of the mouse, relative to (0, 0) of the canvas [3]. After knowing the mouse position, I just need to update the curtain‚Äôs position to match it accordingly. Also in the same function, I am able to determine whether the curtain is fully closed by checking the curtain‚Äôs width. If the curtain is not fully closed, and the audio sound is not played yet, I start the audio. Otherwise, I stop the audio.
