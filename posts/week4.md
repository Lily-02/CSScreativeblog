# Homework s4:

- Create and post a fractal to your blog using recursion and Canvas API.

<script>

// Get rid of the document's default padding.
document.body.style.margin   = 0
document.body.style.overflow = `hidden`

// Get the canvas element and the drawing context
const canvas  = document.createElement ('canvas')
canvas.width  = window.innerWidth
canvas.height = window.innerHeight
document.body.appendChild(canvas)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

function drawBranch(x, y, length, angle, depth) {
    if (depth === 0) return;

    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.save();
    ctx.translate(x, y);
    ctx.rotate(angle * Math.PI / 180);
    ctx.moveTo(0, 0);
    ctx.lineTo(0, -length);
    ctx.stroke();

    drawBranch(0, -length, length * 0.9, -15, depth - 1);
    drawBranch(0, -length, length * 0.9, 15, depth - 1);

    ctx.restore();
}

function drawTree() {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    ctx.strokeStyle = 'brown';
    ctx.lineWidth = 5;

    // Start the tree from the bottom center of the canvas
    drawBranch(canvas.width / 2, canvas.height, 100, 0, 10);
}

drawTree();

</script>

- Inspired by your ‚ÄúFractal Tree via Recursive Function‚Äù example
(https://blog.science.family/240321_recursion), I tried to create a simple fractal tree myself using
HTML&#39;s Canvas API and JavaScript. The goal was to generate a static image representing a fractal
pattern, which is a recurring mathematical phenomenon where a motif is repeated at progressively
smaller scales. Below is how it looks like:

# Resources Used

1. HTML and JavaScript Basics: As foundational knowledge, I relied on your example of using Canvas API and DOM manipulation (https://blog.science.family/240320_canvas_api)

2. Canvas API Documentation: The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs served as a primary resource for understanding the Canvas API&#39;s capabilities, particularly the methods
for drawing paths and setting styles (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)

3. Fractal Geometry: I referred to the book &quot;The Fractal Geometry of Nature&quot; by Mandelbrot, provided by you on Canvas to gain a theoretical understanding of fractals. This document helped me grasp the mathematical principles behind fractal patterns.

4. Recursion: I relied on your example of Recursion to understand how it works and how can I use it to create a fractal (https://blog.science.family/240321_recursion)


# Process

## 1. Understanding Fractals, Recursion and the Canvas API:

- I started by reading the materials you provided in week 4 about fractals, recursion, and Canvas API as I documented above in the ‚ÄúResources Used‚Äù section.

- I also used the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) as my primary resource for more references because of its comprehensive documentation on the Canvas API.

## 2. Setting Up the Environment

- I created a basic HTML file to host my canvas element. This file also linked to an external JavaScript file where I would write the code to draw the fractal tree.
