## Consider **I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS** by **Lauren Lee McCarthy** 

### Can it be an example of mycelial creativity?

Lauren Lee McCarthy's project "I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS" can be seen as a perfect example of mycelial creativity. Just like a fungal mycelium, which spreads its network underground, McCarthy's project reaches beyond physical boundaries by using technology to maintain human connections during the pandemic. 

Each conversation through her platform adds to a growing web of interactions, much like how mycelium accumulates nutrients and spreads. This project also transforms our understanding of communication, providing a new way to connect safely when face-to-face talking is risky.

In essence, McCarthyâ€™s work mirrors the omnidirectional, accumulative, and transformational nature of mycelium, making it a beautiful instance of mycelial creativity.


### Can it belong to the aesthetic category of interesting?

Lauren Lee McCarthy's project "I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS" fits perfectly into the aesthetic category of "interesting." It tackles the new norms of communication brought on by the pandemic, using technology to engage people in a unique and thought-provoking way.

By having participants visit a URL and continue conversations on their phones, the project reflects the "interesting" aesthetic's focus on information exchange and communication. It also prompts reflection on how the pandemic has reshaped our interactions, making it both relevant and engaging.

In essence, McCarthyâ€™s project is interesting because it creatively explores our new reality and invites us to think deeply about the changes in how we connect.
