## My process

- I really enjoy painting and natural landscapes, so I thought about creating a platform where people could generate and show their natural landscape art pieces to each other using Generative AIâ€”a technology that I find both curious and amazing. I developed a web application that allows users to input prompts and receive images using a text-to-image AI model on the main page.

- I also create a gallery page to showcase the art pieces generated by users. 



- First, I figured out how to implement the front-end for my main page. This required an input text field, a submit button to submit the input, and a gallery button to navigate to the gallery page. After pressing the submit button, the generated image would be displayed below, so I created an empty space for it to appear. Initially, I planned to implement buttons for users to submit their images to the gallery, but I realised this would require hosting a server, which wasn't feasible. Instead, I decided to leave a message saying, "Save the image and send it to me to be featured in the Gallery." I encountered a few problems with CSS styling but was able to resolve them. The most important part is how can I get AI models to generate images for me? This implementation requires using JavaScript to handle the API call and button press. I need to first retrieve the prompt, then pass it to my API calling function when the submit button is pressed. The submit button click event is handled as below:


- And my API calling function is handled as below:


- It sends my prompt to the Dall-E 2 model hosted on the cloud by OpenAI and returns an image URL to me. I then update the src attribute of my placeholder image element on the main page with the returned image URL. I also handle the logic of navigating to the gallery page once the gallery button is pressed:


- Important information
One important information I would like you to consider when assessing my AT3 is the problem of private API key exposure to public as I explained to you earlier. The API provider automatically disables any API key that is exposed publicly which prevents you from directly generating images using my web application. To overcome this, I cannot push my API key to GitHub but I will send it to you in the comment on Canvas. I would greatly appreciate if you can replace the API key in the code (script.js) with the key I send in the comment to run it on your side.
